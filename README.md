# A powerful wrapper

An image downloading and processing framework powered by [Gavin Bunney](https://github.com/gavinbunney)'s [Toucan](https://github.com/gavinbunney/Toucan), [Olivier Poitrey](https://github.com/rs)'s [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage), and [Due Munk](https://github.com/duemunk)'s [AsyncSwift](https://github.com/duemunk/Async) all wrapped in an efficient yet powerful wrapper.

With a single fully-featured extension, you can perfrom image downloads, image processing, and image handling all in one go just with a single line of code. All of these processes happen in the background-thread and is never invasive, is performant, and clean.

## Installation

``` Swift
pod 'Tide'
```

## Downloading Images

```Swift
profileImageView.imageFromSource("https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tntOCGkgt98/maxresdefault.jpg")
```

## Processing Images

These are all the options:

```Swift
profileImageView.imageFromSource(
  URL: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tntOCGkgt98/maxresdefault.jpg",
  placeholder: UIImage(named: "default-placeholder"),
  fitMode: .Clip,
  mask: .Squared,
  cornerRadius: 8.0,
  borderWidth: 1.0,
  borderColor: .redColor(),
  animated: true,
  forced: false,
  progress: { progress in

  	// do something with progress

}) { image in

  // do something with image
}
```

## Wrapper Features

- **URL**:	*String?*

	* The url string the image will be downloaded from the web.

- **placeholder**: *UIImage?*

	* The placeholder image that will be used if the image downloaded returns **nil**.

- **fitMode**: *Tide.fitMode*

	* **.Clip** Resizes the image to fit its container without distorting the image. **(default)**
	* **.Crop** Resizes the image to fit its container by cropping excess parts.
	* **.Scale** Resizes the image to fit its container by scaling the image to fit.
	* **.None** Retains the original image size.

- **mask**: *Tide.Mask*

	* **.Rounded** Clips the image with a round cookie cutter, *perfect for profile pictures*.
	* **.Squared** Clips the image with a rounded-edge square cookie cutter.
	* **.None** Leaves the image as is. **(default)**

- **cornerRadius**: *CGFloat*

	* The corner radius for the **.Squared** mask to go off on.
	* 0.0 **(default)**

- **borderWidth**: *CGFloat*

	* The border width of the image after a *mask* is applied.
	* 0.0 **(default)**

- **borderColor**: *UIColor*

	* The border color of the image after a *mask* is applied.
	* .whiteColor() **(default)**

- **animated**: *Bool*

	* If set to *true*, the image will *fade-in* after being set from either the url or placeholder.
	* true **(default)**

- **forced**: *Bool*

	* If set to *true*, if the image downloaded from the web or the image returned from the placeholder is **nil**, then the image set will be nil.
	* This is good if you want to image seen in the app to be dictated by whether or not the url exists.
	* false **(default)**

- **progress**: *(Float -> Void)?*

	* This block gives the progress of the image downloaded from *0 - 100*.

- **block**: *(image: UIImage?) -> Void)?*

	* This block returns the image set from either the image downloaded from the web, the placeholder, the original image set if none are returned from the former two, or **nil** if there were no images returned from any.

## Convenience Functions

* ```.imageFromSource()``` extends to **UIButtons** as well! It comes with all the features along with a *UIControlState* parameter.

* The methods listed below also extend from both **UIImageView** and **UIButton**:

	* ```.fitClip(image: UIImage?, fitMode: .Clip, completionHandler: ((image: UIImage?) -> Void)?)```

	* ```.rounded(image: UIImage?, cornerRadius: CGFloat, borderWidth: CGFloat, borderColor: UIColor, completionHandler: ((image: UIImage?) -> Void)?)```

	* ```.squared(image: UIImage?, cornerRadius: CGFloat, borderWidth: CGFloat, borderColor: UIColor, completionHandler: ((image: UIImage?) -> Void)?)```
